# keycloak/ — demo OIDC issuer for pgauthz

An **opt-in** local Keycloak (26.6.4) that issues the JWTs OPA verifies, so the
"bring your own OIDC provider" story is runnable end-to-end. Real deployments
drop this entirely and point OPA's `JWT_ISSUER` / `JWKS_URL` at their own OAuth2
AS / OIDC OP. The fast self-minted test tokens (`tests/test-authzen.sh`) are
unaffected — this changes nothing about the engine or the test path.

## Layout

```
keycloak/
  themes/            → mounted to /opt/keycloak/themes   (custom login themes)
  extensions/        → mounted to /opt/keycloak/providers (SPI JARs)
  config/
    keycloak.conf            # http behind the proxy, proxy-headers, health
    .env                     # KEYCLOAK_VERSION=26.6.4, bootstrap admin, db password
    generate-mkcerts.sh      # mkcert *.pgauthz.test → certs/
    certs/                   # cert.pem/key.pem/rootCA.pem (gitignored)
    proxy/                   # nginx: TLS termination + host routing
  terraform/                 # realm, authz-api client, mappers, roles, users
  get-token.sh               # fetch a real token (password / client_credentials)
```

Provisioning is **declarative via Terraform** (`keycloak/keycloak` provider),
mirroring the `keycloak-dev-training` conventions. An nginx proxy terminates TLS
for `*.pgauthz.test` (mkcert) and routes by hostname:

| Host | Upstream |
|---|---|
| `id.pgauthz.test`, `admin.pgauthz.test` | Keycloak (issuer + admin console) |
| `api.pgauthz.test`, `pgauthz.test` | OPA (the pgauthz API front door) |

## Quick start

```bash
# 0. these must resolve to loopback (add to /etc/hosts if needed):
#    127.0.0.1 pgauthz.test id.pgauthz.test admin.pgauthz.test api.pgauthz.test

# 1. local TLS cert (once)
./keycloak/config/generate-mkcerts.sh

# 2. bring up the stack + Keycloak overlay
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose-keycloak.yml --env-file keycloak/config/.env up -d

# 3. provision the realm (alice/bob/carol/eva, authz-api client, mappers, roles)
cd keycloak/terraform && terraform init && terraform apply && cd ../..

# 4. get a real token and call the API through the proxy
eval "$(./keycloak/get-token.sh bob)"        # bob has the writer role
curl -sk https://api.pgauthz.test/health -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Admin console: `https://admin.pgauthz.test` (admin / admin — change for anything
real). Issuer: `https://id.pgauthz.test/realms/pgauthz`.

## How OPA trusts it

`compose-keycloak.yml` sets, on the OPA service:

```
JWT_ISSUER=https://id.pgauthz.test/realms/pgauthz
JWKS_URL=http://keycloak:8080/realms/pgauthz/protocol/openid-connect/certs
JWT_ROLES_CLAIM=realm_access.roles,resource_access.authz-api.roles
WRITER_ROLE=authz_writer
```

With `JWKS_URL` set, `authn.rego` fetches the signing keys **live** (cached) from
Keycloak's certs endpoint over the internal `keycloak:8080` backchannel — so OPA
needs no mkcert-CA trust, while tokens still carry the public
`https://id.pgauthz.test` issuer. Unset `JWKS_URL` → OPA falls back to the
static `opa/data/jwks.json` (the default for tests and the no-Keycloak demo).

## Demo subjects

| User | subject_type | Writer role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alice` | internal_user | — | read-only |
| `bob` | internal_user | realm role | writer via `realm_access.roles` |
| `carol` | client_user | — | client subject type |
| `eva` | internal_user | client role | writer via `resource_access.authz-api.roles` |

bob and eva together exercise OPA's role aggregation across **both** claim paths.
Password for all: `password` (override `demo_user_password`).

### App-as-a-service: the `app-dms` client

A second client, **`app-dms`**, demonstrates an application accessing data with
**no human** via the `client_credentials` grant (it has *only* that grant — no
standard/password flow). Its identity is fixed on the **client** (the app), not a
user: hardcoded claim mappers set `subject_type=service_account` and the per-app
`db_role=app_dms`. Its service account is `viewer` of `document:*` in the demo
store, so:

```bash
eval "$(./keycloak/get-token.sh --service app-dms)"   # client_credentials token
# subject_type=service_account, db_role=app_dms, aud=authz-api → can read documents
```

`examples/keycloak/query-demo.sh` ends with this exact call. The `authz-api`
client also has its own service account (`get-token.sh --service`), but it has no
`subject_type`, so — by the fail-closed rule — it is **denied** until granted one.

## Per-app DB role (namespace isolation)

pgauthz can scope writes to a per-app namespace via a Postgres role that OPA
forwards from a token claim (`WRITER_DB_ROLE_CLAIM`). That per-app role is a
property of the **OIDC client (the app)**, not the user — so it's modelled as a
**hardcoded claim mapper on the client**, which stamps `db_role` onto *every*
token the client issues: interactive user logins **and** the client's service
account (`client_credentials`) alike. No user attribute, no escalation surface.

To enable it for a client:

1. uncomment the `keycloak_openid_hardcoded_claim_protocol_mapper "db_role"` in
   [`terraform/client.authz-api.tf`](terraform/client.authz-api.tf) and set its
   `claim_value` to the app's namespace,
2. create a matching Postgres role with the appropriate `namespace_access`, and
3. set `WRITER_DB_ROLE_CLAIM=db_role` on OPA (`compose-keycloak.yml`).

It's off in the demo because the demo store isn't namespaced (a `SET LOCAL ROLE`
to a non-existent role would fail writes). Different apps = different clients,
each with its own hardcoded `db_role` → clean per-tenant isolation, and a
service account representing an app gets the same namespace as its client.

## TLS notes

The proxy uses an mkcert cert for `*.pgauthz.test`; `mkcert -install` trusts the
local CA on your machine, so `curl` / browsers / terraform work without `-k`.
Keycloak trusts the same CA (rootCA.pem mounted into its truststore) so it can
reach itself via the frontend URL. `certs/*.pem` is gitignored — never commit it.
